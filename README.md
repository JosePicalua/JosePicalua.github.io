Hiring Manager

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to express my interest in a Data Analyst role within your organization. As a dedicated and self-driven data professional with strong practical experience in Python, SQL, and statistical analysis, I bring a solid analytical mindset and the ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets.

Over the last several months, I have developed and executed independent projects that mirror real-world challenges in data analysis. These include fraud detection using imbalanced datasets and machine learning models, e-commerce A/B testing with statistical validation, and SQL-based reporting on patient and operational data. My technical expertise includes tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and PostgreSQL.

I have built data cleaning frameworks to handle missing values, detect outliers, and normalize features for machine learning pipelines. I’ve also conducted hypothesis testing, explored binomial distributions, and implemented feature engineering strategies to improve model outcomes.

My approach is structured yet creative: I enjoy not only solving data problems but also presenting the results clearly through storytelling and visualization. I am eager to bring this skillset to a forward-thinking team that values data-driven decisions and continuous improvement.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and motivation can support your team’s data initiatives. Please find my resume attached.

Sincerely,
Antonny
